# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Japan Environmental Dashboard
### By Kevin Chaplin

## Project Goals
- Display relevant Japan centric data on issues related to climate change in an easy to understand and engaging format.

## Personal Goals
- Simulate a real work environment by using the Kanban work management system.
- Design and build my own project using the D3js framework to enhance my skills there.
- Use complex real-world REST API for data.
- Add dual language functionality to a project for the first time.

## Design Choices

## If I had more time I would ...
- Choropleth and climate line graph are using the same data sets. They currently use separate API fetch functions. However, I would like to combine into one API call and compare performance. ie. Several smaller API fetch vs one large API fetch.
- Would like to try the same project using React. Think it would be better to have separate components drawing on the data held within state variables. Didn't try with this run to limit my focus on learning more about D3.js. and to prevent dealing with too many new situations at once.
